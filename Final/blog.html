    <h2>Docker: what is DeviceMapper</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DeviceMapper since Linux 2.6 was introduced in Linux has become the most important technology. It supports common device mapping mechanism Logical Volume Manager in the kernel, which is used for the realization of storage resource management block device driver provides a highly modular kernel architecture, it contains three important objects concept, Mapped Device, Mapping Table , Target device.

    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mapped Device is a logical abstraction, understood as a logical device can be provided by the kernel out, the mapping between it and described by Mapping Table Target Device establish mappings. Target device represents the physical space segment Mapped Device mapped, Mapped Device logical device indicated, it is the logical device is mapped to a physical device.

    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There Mapped Device Mapping Table logical starting address, range, and indicates the physical device where the Target Device Address Offset and Target type and other information (Note: These addresses and offsets are in units of sectors to disk , that is 512 bytes in size, so when you see 128, when, in fact, represents the 128 * 512 = 64K).


    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DeviceMapper Mapped Device logical device not only can be mapped to one or more physical devices Target Device, you can also map another Mapped Device, then, it is to constitute a case of an iterative or recursive directory as the file system in addition to file further the directory can, in theory, unlimited nested down.

    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DeviceMapper in the kernel through a Target Driver a modular plug-in implementation of the IO request filter or re-orientation, etc., has achieved the current plug-ins include soft Raid, encryption, multi-path, mirroring, snapshots, which reflects the Linux kernel the principle of the separation of policy and mechanism design. As shown below. From the figure, we can see DeviceMapper only a framework, in this framework, we can insert a variety of strategies (so I do not naturally think in object-oriented policy model), in which many "plug-in" in , there is a thing called Thin Provisioning Snapshot, which is Docker use DeviceMapper most important module.</p>
